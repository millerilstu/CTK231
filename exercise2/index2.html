    <p>“In the same way your heart feels and your mind thinks, you, mortal beings, are the instrument by which the universe cares. If you choose to care, then the universe cares. If you don't, then it doesn't.” <br>

    <p>This is an image of a poster from the WPA Illinois Safety Division with the organization's logo in the bottom left corner. The artwork on the poster is lineless. A figure made up of solid colored shapes wears a black shirt and hat, as well as a pair of safety goggles. The text at the top of the poster reads: "Save your eyes, use your goggles."</p>
